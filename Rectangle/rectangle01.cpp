/*Write a C++ program rectangle01.cpp that calculates some parameters for a rectangle. 

Create a rectangle class and do all operations detailed subsequently on rectangle object/s.

The program prompts the user for length (inches) and breadth (inches) of a rectangle.

It then calls a function area( ) to calculate the area of the rectangular board 
(length x breadth, in square inches) and reports it.

It then calls another function perimeter( ) to calculate the perimeter of the 
rectangular board (sum of its four sides, in inches) and reports it.

It then calls a fourth function diagonal( ) that calculates the length of a 
diagonal of the rectangular board (âˆš(length ^2 + breadth ^2), in inches) and reports it.

If the cost of painting the board is $2.09 per square inch, also call a cost( ) 
function that indicates the cost of painting (in US$) the board on one side. 

Make sure your painting cost has just two digits after the decimal point.
